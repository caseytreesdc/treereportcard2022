# treereportcard2021
## The TRC: Casey Trees' Annual Report on the state of DC's trees.
### To make a new trc for the next year, this process works:
  1. `mkdir treereportcard2022`
  2. `git init`
  3. Copy all files and folders, except the `.git` directory, and `.gitignore` file if there is one from the old trc into the new folder.
  4. Push to github.
  5. Publish to Github Pages.
  6. We are pushing prior to updating so that there is a live site that can be reviewed.
  7. Update and push new copy/content as needed.
